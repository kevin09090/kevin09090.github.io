        <h2> KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders 
             an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken 
             from his roadside restaurant in Corbin.. Sanders identified
               the potential of the restaurant franchising 
               concept, and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken"
                franchise opened in Utah in 1952.
                In July 1940, Sanders finalised what came 
        to be known as his "Original Recipe" of 11 herbs and spices.</h2>
